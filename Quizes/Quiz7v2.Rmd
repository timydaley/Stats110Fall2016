Remember to state the logic behind your answers.  If you use any variables, please state what the variables represent.

Consider sampling $n$ observations from a uniform distribution on $-C$ to $C$ for some unknown $C$.  Note that this distribution has expectation $0$, variance $C^{2}/3$, and pdf $f(x) = 1 / 2C$ for $-C \leq x \leq C$ and $0$ otherwise.
