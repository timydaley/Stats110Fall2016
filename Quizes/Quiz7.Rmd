Remember to state the logic behind your answers.  If you use any variables, please state what the variables represent.

In species sampling experiments, the number of capture species is thought to be Poisson distributed with pmf $f(x | \lambda) = \lambda^{x} e^{-\lambda} / x!$.  Unfortunately, captured species are not observed.  In this case, the observed species follow a zero-truncated distribution with pmf $f(x) = \Pr(X = x | X > 0)$.  Suppose we observe $n$ species with counts $s_{1}, \ldots, s_{n}$. \newline
