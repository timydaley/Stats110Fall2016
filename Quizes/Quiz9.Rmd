Remember to state the logic behind your answers.  If you use any variables, please state what the variables represent.

1. If $k$ is small in a $k$-fold cross validation is the bias in the estimate of out-of-sample (test set) accuracy smaller or bigger?
\
\
\
\
2. What is $k$ in leave one out cross validation?
\
\
\
\
3. 	For the following question select all that are correct.  Stepwise regression is a method to:
a. eliminate extraneous variables from a multiple regression equation.
b. select the best regression equation with a single independent variable.
c. select independent variables to include in a multiple regression equation that increases the $R^{2}$ the most.

4.  For the following question select all that are correct.  The adjusted $R^{2}$  
a. equals the ratio of $RSS = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i})^2$ to $TSS = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_{i} - \bar{y})^{2}$
b. takes values in the range of $-1$ to $1$
c. equals the ratio of $RSS = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i})^2$ to $TSS = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_{i} - \bar{y})^{2}$, corrected for the number of independent variables ($x$'s) in the regression equation.


5. For the following question select all that apply.  Which of the following methods are appropriate for selecting the best model from among a choice of models:
a. Choose the model with the highest $R^{2}$.
b. Choose the model with the highest $C_{p}$.
c. Choose the model with the lowest BIC.
d. Choose the model with the lowest AIC.
e. Choose the model with lowest cross-validation mean square error.
