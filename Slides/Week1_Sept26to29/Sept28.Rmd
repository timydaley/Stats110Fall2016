# Conditional Probability

- The conditional probability of A given B, $\Pr(A|B)$, is the probability that A occurs over all events that include B.  

![Back to the Venn diagram](venn_intersection.jpg)

- The conditional probability is amount that A overlaps with B, relative to the total amount of B

$$\Pr(A | B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)}$$
