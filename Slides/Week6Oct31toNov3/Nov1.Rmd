# From last class: 

- The null hypothesis is the opposite of what you want to show.

- The $p$-value is the probability of obtaining the observed data or something more extreme under the null hypothesis.
    - This is **not** the probability the null is true.
    
# Confidence level

- Before you perform a hypothesis test, you should set a confidence level.
    - Usually $90 \%$, $95 \%$, or $99 \%$
    - Corresponds to $\alpha = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01$

- If $100 (1 - \alpha) \%$ is the confidence level, then $\alpha$ is the probability of obtaining the observed data or something more extreme under the null
     - $\alpha$ is the probability of rejecting the null under the null hypothesis.
