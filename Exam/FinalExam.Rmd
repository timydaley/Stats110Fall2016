1. (4 points) If you believe that only a small number of variables are important, which of the following regression approaches are appropriate ways to select the important variables:
    i. Ridge regression
    ii. Lasso regression
    iii. p-values.
    iv. Forward stepwise regression
    \
    \
    \
    
2.  (4 points) The $R^{2}$ in the linear regression $Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X + \epsilon$ from data $(y_{1}, x_{1}), \ldots, (y_{n}, x_{n})$ represents which of the following:
    i. the fraction of variance $Y$ explained by $\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X$
    ii. the expected prediction error for new data $(y_{n+ 1}, x_{n+ 1}), \ldots, (y_{2n}, x_{2n})$
    iii. the square of the correlation between $Y$ and $\hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1} X$

3.  (4 points) Identify and describe at least one problem or confounding factor in the following experimental design.  
  *Arabadopsis thaliana* is a flowering plant native to Europe.  Strains in northern Europe tend to have an earlier flowering time than strains in southern Europe.  To identify epigenetic factors that may contribute to the difference, researchers took samples from Tunisia and Norway. The samples were processed for bisulfite sequencing on site and then sent to a central sequencing center for processing and analysis.

4. (8 points) Suppose we have data on a response variable $Y$ and three predictor variables $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$.  We fit the models on all possible subsets. Circle the model that will be selected according the following criteria.


| criterion  | $X_{1}$ | $X_{2}$ | $X_{1}, X_{2}$ |
|------------|---------|---------|----------------|
|  AIC       |  126.86 |  106.57 |    106.59      |
|  BIC       |  129.85 |  109.56 |    110.57      |
| adj $R^2$  |  -0.023 |  0.63   |    0.64        |
| 10-fold CV |  402.56 |  131.34 |    151.99      |

7. In species sampling experiments, the number of individuals captured from each species is thought to be Poisson distributed with pmf $f(x) = \Pr(X = x) = \lambda ^{x} e^{- \lambda} / x!$.  Unfortunately, species with no captured individuals are not observed.  In this case, the number of individuals captured for each observed species (those with at least one observed individual) follows a zero-truncated Poisson distribution with pmf $f(x) = \Pr(X = x | X > 0)$.  Suppose we observed $10$ species with counts $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{10}$.
    a. (4 points)  If $\lambda = 2$, what is the probability $X = 2$?

8. A new internet provider claims that using their system you can get transmission speeds of 1 gigabits per second.   To test that consumers are getting at least the advertised speed,  regulators visit 100 houses and measure speeds of 0.956 gb/s with an estimated standard deviation 0.213 gb/s.  
    a.  (3 points) State the null and alternative hypotheses.

    \
    \
    \
    \
    \
    \
    \
    d.  (5 points) Suppose the true speed is Normal with average speed of 0.96 gb/s and standard deviation of 0.2 gb/s.  What is the approximate power of the test assuming a null distribution of $N(1, 0.2)$ at the $95 \%$ confidence level and $n = 100$?

9.  To bid for government contracts, businesses submit bids and the government selects the lowest bid that satisfies the criteria.  Suppose that bids are exponentially distributed with average bid equal to \$ 10 million.
