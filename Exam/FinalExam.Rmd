1. (4 points) If you believe that only a small number of variables are important, which of the following regression approaches can you use to select the important variables:
    i. Ridge regression
    ii. Lasso regression
    iii. p-values.
    iv. Forward stepwise regression
    \
    \
    \
    
2.  (4 points) The $R^{2}$ in the linear regression $Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X + \epsilon$ from data $(y_{1}, x_{1}), \ldots, (y_{n}, x_{n})$ represents which of the following:
    i. the fraction of variance $Y$ explained by $\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X$
    ii. the expected prediction error for new data $(y_{n+ 1}, x_{n+ 1}), \ldots, (y_{2n}, x_{2n})$
    iii. the square of the correlation between $Y$ and $\hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1} X$

3.  (4 points) Identify and describe at least one problem or confounding factor in the following experimental design.  
  *Arabadopsis thaliana* is a flowering plant native to Europe.  Strains in northern Europe tend to have an earlier flowering time than strains in southern Europe.  To identify epigenetic factors that may contribute to the difference, researchers took samples from Tunisia and Norway. The samples were processed for bisulfite sequencing on site and then sent to a central sequencing center for processing and analysis.

4. (8 points) Suppose we have data on a response variable $Y$ and three predictor variables $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$.  We fit the models on all possible subsets. Circle the model that will be selected according the following criteria.


| criterion  | $X_{1}$ | $X_{2}$ | $X_{1}, X_{2}$ |
|------------|---------|---------|----------------|
|  AIC       |  126.86 |  106.57 |    106.59      |
|  BIC       |  129.85 |  109.56 |    110.57      |
| adj $R^2$  |  -0.023 |  0.63   |    0.64        |
| 10-fold CV |  402.56 |  131.34 |    151.99      |

5. Using a subsample of the Structural Survey of Wages for Spain in 2006, the following model is estimated to explain wages (in tens of thousands of dollars) as a function of education (in years:

6.  Suppose we have 9 predictor variables and 1 response variable.  We run best subset regression and obtain the following estimates of training and test error for the number of predictor variables ranging from 0 to 9 (labeled dimension).

7. In species sampling experiments, the number of individuals captured from each species is thought to be Poisson distributed with pmf $f(x) = \Pr(X = x) = \lambda ^{x} e^{- \lambda} / x!$.  Unfortunately, species with no captured individuals are not observed.  In this case, the number of individuals captured for each observed species (those with at least one observed individual) follows a zero-truncated Poisson distribution with pmf $f(x) = \Pr(X = x | X > 0)$.  Suppose we observed $10$ species with counts $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{10}$.

8. A new internet provider claims that using their system you can get transmission speeds of upwards of 1 gigabits per second.   To test this regulators visit 100 houses and measure speeds  of 0.956 gb/s with an estimated standard deviation 0.213 gb/s.
